## Proxy - Web based PHP Proxy

PHProxy is a web HTTP proxy written in php. It is designed to bypass proxy restrictions through a web interface very similar to the popular CGIProxy. The only thing that PHProxy needs is a web server with PHP installed (see Requirements below). Be aware though, that the sever has to be able to access those resources to deliver them to you.

Originaly developed in [SourceForge](http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/poxy/) during 2002-2007 and then abandoned. This project needs to live, this is why I  have copied it here and will continue to develop it.

## Bugs and Limitations

PHP is retarded by nature, and as such, some problems arise that 
would have not if this script were otherwise coded in another programming
language. The first example of this is dots in incoming variable names 
from POST and GET. In a normal programming language, this wouldn't be
a problem as these variables could be accessed normally as they are 
supplied, with dots included. In PHP, however, dots in GET, POST, and
COOKIE variable names are magically transformed into underscores 
because of the stupid shit that is register_globals.

Basically use at your own risk.
